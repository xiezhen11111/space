For the purposes of this tutorial, you can use the sprite sheet as-is. There are three steps to
use a sprite sheet in Cocos2D:
1. Create a CCSpriteBatchNode, specifying the image generated by TexturePacker
(Sprites.pvr.ccz in this case).
2. Use the CCSpriteFrameCache to load the plist generated by TexturePacker
(Sprites.plist in this case).
3. When adding sprites, you should add them as children of the CCSpriteBatchNode (not
children of the layer!) This way, you will get the performance benefit that
CCSpriteBatchNode offers.
